Weather App
Display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures, and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until you’ve got everything rendering correctly.

You might notice that the “days” look a lot like social cards…

For added practice, here are a few ways you could expand on the app:

Add the ability to click on a day, and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.


- Add React Router to the project (`npm install react-router`) and follow the quick start guide [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) to add routes, such that `/` shows the 5-day forecast, and `/[name-of-day]` shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
- Sign up for a free API key from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/), fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.
- Want to get really fancy? Add a graphics library like [vx](https://vx-demo.now.sh/) and follow the examples [here](https://medium.com/vx-code/getting-started-with-vx-1756bb661410) to add a graph of the temperature over the course of a week or day.


You can see how this app starts off simple, but can be expanded and customized to increase the challenge and learn specific new skills.
